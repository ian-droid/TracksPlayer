# TracksPlayer

A simple multi-tracks video player with minimal function set to play video files like in video editors.

It's written in PyQt5, and has only been tested under Debian Bookworm. For Windows users, you may need additional codec to make Qt Media Player working.

It saves track(s) info in YAML, so the playing sequence can be easily edited with text editors (before the GUI is fully Functional).

## Requirements 
- Python3 (3.7+)
- PyQt5
- YAML
- MediaInfo

## To Do
- Frameless player window.
- Draggable clips.
